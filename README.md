# RocketBacktracking
Backtracking practice for Advanced Algorithms class.
## Coding Homework Description:
Given a sorted list of lengths of sections for a rocket build, and the length of rocket the user wants to make, find the least number of sections that the use can use to construct the rocket. This coding homework is a rendition of the knapsack problem, where you have to fill the fixed-size sack with the most valuable items.
## Run the Lab:
- On Windows:
type [input file] | python RocketBacktracking.py
## Sample Output:
### - sample1.txt:
1 of length 1  
0 of length 2  
0 of length 5  
2 of length 7  
3 rocket sections minimum
### - sample2.txt:
1 of length 1  
0 of length 2  
0 of length 3  
0 of length 5  
0 of length 7  
1 of length 14  
2 rocket sections minimum
### - sample3.txt
8 of length 1  
1 of length 9  
9 rocket sections minimum
### - sample4.txt
0 of length 1  
2 of length 9  
0 of length 10  
2 rocket sections minimum
### - sample5.txt
0 of length 1  
2 of length 9  
0 of length 10  
2 of length 90  
0 of length 100  
4 rocket sections minimum
